A simple linear regression machine learning model for predicting the total cases of pandemic from OWID dataset. Built using Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels, Pickle, Matplotlib, Seaborn). Model is further represented as a Flask Web Application with a backend database connectivity to SQLite3 using SQLAlchemy. Later deployed to Heroku PaaS on Cloud Platform (Webserver used: Waitress, Version control: git bash). As an alternative also Dockerized this application to decommission the need of storing onto local setup or virtual environment
